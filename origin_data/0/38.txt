Connecting to data

Welcome to Deepnote!
Just follow one of the methods below

Importing files & connecting data sources
In Deepnote, you can jump right into data exploration after connecting your notebook to a data source or importing existing files. Here's how:

Upload an existing file - drag and drop local .ipynb notebooks, CSV files, and images into the right-hand sidebar and start querying.

import data from GitHub or Google Drive - simply copy and paste your GitHub repo or connect to Google Drive to retrieve data.

Connect to a cloud data source - tap into your data stack with native integrations for Postgres, S3, Snowflake, BigQuery, and dozens more. See all integrations.
