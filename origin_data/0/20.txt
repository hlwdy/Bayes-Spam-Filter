Subject: Request for information

Dear Steve,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request some information. I am currently researching this area and would greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations you may have.

If you have some time, I would love to schedule a call or meeting to discuss this further. Please let me know if this works for you, and if so, what times are most convenient.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
