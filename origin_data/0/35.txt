Subject: Join us for a virtual happy hour Hi team,

I hope this email finds you all well and healthy. I know itâ€™s been a challenging and stressful time for everyone, so I wanted to invite you to join us for a virtual happy hour this Friday at 5:00 p.m.

This is a casual and fun opportunity to catch up with each other, share some stories, and have some laughs. There is no agenda or formalities, just bring your favorite drink and join the Zoom meeting using the link below:

I hope you can make it and I look forward to seeing your smiling faces. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Cheers, Alice Team Leader
