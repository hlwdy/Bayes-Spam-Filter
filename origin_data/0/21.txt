Subject: Thank you for your hospitality

Dear Johnson,

I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your wonderful hospitality during my recent visit. Your kindness and generosity made my stay memorable and enjoyable.

I hope to return the favor someday and show you the same hospitality when you visit my city. Please let me know if you have any plans to visit China in the near future.

Once again, thank you for everything. It was a pleasure to spend time with you.

Best wish,
