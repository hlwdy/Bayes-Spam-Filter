Subject: Invitation to dinner party

Hello Steve,

I would like to invite you to a dinner party at my house next Friday. The party will start at 7pm and there will be plenty of food and drinks.

Please let me know if you can make it by Wednesday so I can make the necessary arrangements. I hope to see you there!

Best regards,
Bety
