Subject: Follow-up on our meeting

Dear Alice,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me earlier this week. It was great to discuss "How to work" with you and learn more about your business.

As we discussed, I am following up with some additional information that I think might be helpful for you. Please find attached a document with some key statistics and case studies related to our product.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
