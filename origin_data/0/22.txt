Subject: Invitation to dinner party

Dear Peter,

I would like to invite you to a dinner party that I am hosting at my house at 9:00. It will be a casual and fun evening with good food, drinks, and company.

I hope you can join us for the event. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences so that I can plan accordingly.

Looking forward to seeing you soon.
