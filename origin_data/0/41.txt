Thank you for joining the waitlist to build with GPT-4!

To balance capacity with demand, we'll be sending invites gradually over time.

While we ramp up, invites will be prioritized to developers who have previously build with the OpenAI API. You can also gain priority access if you contribute model evaluations to OpenAI Evals that get merged, as this will help us improve the models for everyone.

Once you're off the waitlist, you'll receive an email with further instructions on how to get started. We will process requests for the 8K and 32K models at different rates based on capacity, so you can expect to receive 8K access first.

We appreciate your interest, and look forward to having you build with GPT-4 soon. In the meantime, we suggest getting started with gpt-3.5-turbo, the model powering ChatGPT.

- The OpenAI Team

P.S. You can also preview GPT-4 on chat.openai.com if you're a ChatGPT Plus subscriber. We expect to be severely capacity constrained, so there will be a usage cap for the model depending on demand and system performance.
