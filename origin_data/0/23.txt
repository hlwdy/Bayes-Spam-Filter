Subject: Follow-up on our project

Dear Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me last week to discuss our project. I found our conversation to be very insightful, and I appreciate your expertise and perspective.

As we discussed, I will follow up with some additional information that I think might be helpful for our project. Please find attached a document with some key statistics and case studies related to our goals.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

Lauren
