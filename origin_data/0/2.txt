Subject: Lunch meeting tomorrow

Hi all,

Just a quick reminder that we have a lunch meeting scheduled tomorrow at 12 pm in the conference room. We'll be discussing the latest updates on the project, so please come prepared with any questions or concerns you may have.

Also, please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions and we'll make sure to order something that accommodates everyone.

Looking forward to seeing you all tomorrow!

Best,
John
