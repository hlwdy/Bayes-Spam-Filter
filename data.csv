From:	mike

It's working here.  I have departed almost totally from the Bell Labs
recommended configuration.  I'm running a hacked version of the
terminal kernel on Sparcs, booting off local disc, using a remote Unix
machine running a hacked ""u9fs"" as the file server.  Lots of things
don't work yet.  I have a TODO list a light-year long.  I expect many
of my problems would go away if we had the resources to dedicate a CPU
server (to run daemons) and a file server.

I'm interested in hearing how others are doing...

From:	Scott Schwartz

Greetings all.  This is a mass acknowledgement to everyone who has
signed on to the plan9-fans list to date, now that influx has slowed
down a bit.  (There are 75 people on the list right now.)

One person has suggested that the name of the list be changed to
9fans.  There's already an alias for that, in any event.

The list is not being archived (that I know of).  If someone wants to
do it, that would be great.

"Subject: Plan 9 utilities...

Three things for your general edification/amusement:

For those interested, there is a program called 9x in
ftp.cs.su.oz.au:/matty which provides a remote graphical connection
to a Plan 9 machine on an X terminal.  The code needs to be cleaned up
(please don't look at it too much if you get it -- I will be mortified
if you do), and it doesn't support the polysegment primitive as yet,
but it's useful if you can get it to work nevertheless.  You will
need the libXg library from research.att.com (the one with the sam
distribution) to build it.

Secondly, on the same site in /matty/unicode, there are utf versions
of libXg which will, when compiled with sam enable it to edit utf
encoded files, i.e, files containing Runes encoded as Plan 9 encodes
them using the utf-2 encoding.  The libXg and libframe libraries are
both needed as well as the font archive.

There is also a program 9term which may be used a replacement for
xterm and which provides a 8.5 (8 1/2) like window for Unix: editable
command line and output, cut/snarf/send, and if you compile with the
right libraries, utf facilities.  This is fairly stable.  It only
works on a few systems at present so if you port it please tell me.
It's still a beta version but that's probably because I'm lazy and
haven't done a last touch up more than anything else.  I've not
used xterm in any major fashion since last October or so and having
the Plan 9 `look and feel' under Unix is a big win (plug, plug!).
The current version in the directory is 1.1.1 but 1.2 should be there
in the next few days.

					Matty.",0
"Subject: Re: Plan 9 beginner's questions

To shut down a terminal ctrl-t ctrl-t r.  This should be fine if it's
diskless.  If it isn't - no idea.  To cancell a process (delete or
numlock on some keyboard) will kill things in a window's process group.
This is in the 8.5 manual page.  To stop and resume text output: put
the window into non-scroll mode and use the page-down/VIEW key (again
check the manual pages like 8.5 and keyboard(6)), its altgraph on some
keyboard and the arrow keys on others.  This will scroll half a page.
Output is blocked while it can't be displayed, i.e., while it's off
the bottom of the page.

"In the good old days, copyright notices meant something.
The latest instance of their devaluation is Matty's posting
in a public place of a number of copyrighted fonts from
the Plan 9 distribution (itself a violation of the copyright)
without reproducing the notice (which would be our
request to anyone who asked to copy them).

For those interested in maintaining the principle of
letting artists maintain ownership of their work, the
fonts Matty distributed should be stored with the
following notice:

"Subject: Dumb, fundamental question.

Is Plan 9 primarily intended as an operating system to do research on, or into?

Many of the postings on comp.os.research which run 'Plan 9 should have 
interesting feature x' seem to cast (recast?) Plan 9 as a operating system to
which exists for the purpose of investigating certain operating system ideas.
The impression I have from the Plan 9 literature so far seems to indicate that
the emphasis is more on creating a usable system, given certain ideas about
operating system design, namespaces and so on. I'm not asking whether Plan 9
is a pure research system or a pure production system - just which is considered
more important.

"Subject: Re: Fonts and unicode distribution... 
Date:	Wed, 28 Apr 1993 14:02:46 -0400
From:	mike

Although fonts themselves cannot be protected, it's likely
that the actual data file representing a particular instance
of a font is protectible.

For example, I dare you to redistribute one of Adobe's Type I
data files.

Consequently, the interesting questions regarding the Plan 9
fonts are:

(1) How did Bell Labs derive the bitmap data?  If they digitized
    the fonts themselves from, say, blown up photographs, they
    are on safe legal ground.  Likewise if they constructed the
    fonts by hand with a bitmap editor.  (Given that these fonts
    look awfully reminescent of the ""blit"" fonts, I suspect that
    they date to the early 1980's and were constructed by hand.)

(2) How does Bell Labs feel about us using their bitmap data
    files?

The answer to #2 seems to be ""Fine, so long as the copyright
notice is preserved on all copies.""

"The mailing list I queried about a few weeks ago is now up and
running.  I have also set up an archive server; see below.  The
following is the official welcome to the list message at the moment.

Joe Buehler

--------------------

This mailing list is for people who desire serious, orthodox
discussion of the Roman Catholic religion.  I assume that it will
cater mainly to Catholics, but everyone else is welcome, provided they
operate within the below guidelines.  My own interests have a
doctrinal bent, but I'm certainly not going to limit this list to just
that sort of discussion.

Having participated in USENET religion groups for about 5 years now,
one of my primary observations about Catholics on the net is that they
do not know their religion very well.  My hope is that this list might
help remedy this problem to some extent.  I would like to make this a
net resource available for Catholics who want to know more about their
religion.

As far as moderation policy goes: The Catholic Church is not a
democracy, it's a monarchy subject to a divinely given constitution.
I don't set the rules in the Church, neither does my parish priest,
nor does my bishop, nor does the Pope.  Everyone has to adhere to the
way Christ set things up.  I think it follows that it's not really
appropriate for someone to call himself a Catholic and argue with this
state of affairs.  If you want to be Catholic, it's simple enough, you
have to follow the teaching of the Church.

The moderation policy will reflect this way of thinking: there are
plenty of other places on the net where Catholic doctrine can be
freely attacked!  If in doubt, you can always subscribe, and see
whether the list is to your taste.

Besides the mailing list, there are a few other things that may be of
interest:

- I have set up an archive server that we can put interesting things
in.  (It doesn't have anything in it at the moment except some UNIX
software useful for such endeavors.)  Sorry, guys, but nothing that's
copyrighted goes into it!

- I am planning on setting up a quotation server that can email
periodic interesting citations from the principal sources of Catholic
doctrine.  (Not done yet.)

- I have obtained permission from the English language publishers of
the Italian Catholic magazine ""30 Days"" to take material from their
magazine.  I intend to scan some of the more interesting pictures
(ever seen a Cristero?  or St. Pius X?) and put them in the archives,
and also post extracts from some of the more interesting articles.
(It's a European magazine, and is of generally higher quality than
American Catholic material.  In my opinion...)

KOKO Petroleum, Inc. announced today that its operator for the Corsicana Field, JMT Resources, Ltd. (""JMT"") will commence a re-work program on its Pecan Gap wells in the next week. The re-work program will consist of drilling six lateral bore production strings from the existing well bore. This process, known as Radial Jet Enhancement, will utilize high pressure fluids to drill the lateral well bores, which will extend out approximately 350' each.

JMT has contracted with Well Enhancement Services, LLC (www.wellenhancement.com) to perform the rework on its Pierce nos. 14 and 14a. A small sand frac will follow the drilling of the lateral well bores in order to enhance permeability and create larger access to the Pecan Gap reservoir. Total cost of the re-work per well is estimated to be approximately $50,000 USD.

Well Enhancement Services has reported increases in production for wells where the lateral was successfully placed. Average increases are reported to be from 300% to 1000%, which justify the incremental cost associated with the re-work project. Assuming positive results, JMT will re-work the second well, which is adjacent to the first and schedule the rework on its remaining Pecan Gap wells, which currently total 8.

KOKO announces that JMT has completed drilling the 4th pilot well for the Corsicana Flood Project. We plan on drilling 7 production wells and 6 injection wells prior to the implementation of the alkaline-surfactant-polymer technology.",1
